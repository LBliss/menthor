* Clean up source: directories for packages, merge different version of ProcessingParallel

* TODO Create an archive containing source and build file

* TODO Create web page with tutorial
** How to download source
** How to build
** How to run
** Example output

* TODO add test to build file whether compiled classes already exist

* Make ProcessingParallelComposable work for PageRank

*WASTE-OF-LIFE'S TASKS:
* NIPS outline
* Survey the best/most-interesting ML algs at NIPS for parallelization.
* Figure out what in Vetterli's lab we can apply ADMM to. 
* DONE Ant build script
  CLOSED: [2011-03-03 Thu 10:49]
* Datasets

Possibilities: 
* Dist optimization - nice for NIPS is that it's a real problem with real data and a real application
* Restricted Boltzmann machines (deep learning?) - composability point
