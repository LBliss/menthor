* Clean up source: directories for packages, merge different version of ProcessingParallel
* Make ProcessingParallelComposable work for PageRank

*WASTE-OF-LIFE'S TASKS:
* NIPS outline
* Survey the best/most-interesting ML algs at NIPS for parallelization.
* Figure out what in Vetterli's lab we can apply ADMM to. 
* Make git repository, build script? 
* Datasets

Possibilities: 
* Dist optimization - nice for NIPS is that it's a real problem with real data and a real application
* Restricted Boltzmann machines (deep learning?) - composability point
